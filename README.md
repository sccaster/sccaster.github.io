# About Me
## My Interests
My interests are very tame but here is a list to sort them out:
* spending time with my kids
* playing video games
* attending church
* listening to audio books

## Video Games I Recommend
  - [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) - Minecraft is now 16 years old but continues to
    update and ferment like a fine wine. That is not even taking into consideration the modding
    atmosphere that surrounds it.

  - [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) - Dota 2 is Steam's game platform of what once was a mod for
    Warcraft 3. However, in the esports world it has produced tournaments with the largest grossing prize
    pool of all time coming in at 40 million dollars.

  -[Escape From Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/?utm_source=launcher&utm_medium=menu&utm_campaign=head&utm_term=expansions_link) - Escape From Tarkov is the
  Russian build extraction shooter that started a genre craze from the early 2020's to our current year of 2025.
  With complex gun customization and an unforgiving gameplay loop, this game has captivated the shooting genre for years
  and makes its 1.0 debut this year.
